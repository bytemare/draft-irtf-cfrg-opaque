                  The OPAQUE Asymmetric PAKE Protocol
                     draft-irtf-cfrg-opaque-latest

Abstract

   This document describes the OPAQUE protocol, a secure asymmetric
   password-authenticated key exchange (aPAKE) that supports mutual
   authentication in a client-server setting without reliance on PKI and
   with security against pre-computation attacks upon server compromise.
   In addition, the protocol provides forward secrecy and the ability to
   hide the password from the server, even during password registration.
   This document specifies the core OPAQUE protocol, along with several
   instantiations in different authenticated key exchange protocols.

1.  Introduction

   Password authentication is the prevalent form of authentication in
   the web and in many other applications.  In the most common
   implementation, a client authenticates to a server by sending its
   client ID and password to the server over a TLS connection.  This
   makes the password vulnerable to server mishandling, including
   accidentally logging the password or storing it in cleartext in a
   database.  Server compromise resulting in access to these plaintext
   passwords is not an uncommon security incident, even among security-
   conscious companies.  Moreover, plaintext password authentication
   over TLS is also vulnerable to TLS failures, including many forms of
   PKI attacks, certificate mishandling, termination outside the
   security perimeter, visibility to middle boxes, and more.

   Asymmetric (or Augmented) Password Authenticated Key Exchange (aPAKE)
   protocols are designed to provide password authentication and
   mutually authenticated key exchange in a client-server setting
   without relying on PKI (except during client/password registration)
   and without disclosing passwords to servers or other entities other
   than the client machine.  A secure aPAKE should provide the best
   possible security for a password protocol.  Namely, it should only be
   open to inevitable attacks, such as online impersonation attempts
   with guessed client passwords and offline dictionary attacks upon the
   compromise of a server and leakage of its password file.  In the
   latter case, the attacker learns a mapping of a client's password
   under a one-way function and uses such a mapping to validate
   potential guesses for the password.  Crucially important is for the
   password protocol to use an unpredictable one-way mapping.
   Otherwise, the attacker can pre-compute a deterministic list of
   mapped passwords leading to almost instantaneous leakage of passwords
   upon server compromise.

   Despite the existence of multiple designs for (PKI-free) aPAKE
   protocols, none of these protocols are secure against pre-computation
   attacks.  In particular, none of these protocols can use the standard
   technique against pre-computation that combines _secret_ random
   values ("salt") into the one-way password mappings.  Either these
   protocols do not use a salt at all or, if they do, they transmit the
   salt from server to client in the clear, hence losing the secrecy of
   the salt and its defense against pre-computation.  Furthermore,
   transmitting the salt may require additional protocol messages.

   This document describes OPAQUE, a PKI-free secure aPAKE that is
   secure against pre-computation attacks and capable of using a secret
   salt.  OPAQUE provides forward secrecy (essential for protecting past
   communications in case of password leakage) and the ability to hide
   the password from the server - even during password registration.
   Furthermore, OPAQUE enjoys good performance and an array of
   additional features including the ability to increase the difficulty
   of offline dictionary attacks via iterated hashing or other hardening
   schemes, and offloading these operations to the client (that also
   helps against online guessing attacks); extensibility of the protocol
   to support storage and retrieval of client's secrets solely based on
   a password; and being amenable to a multi-server distributed
   implementation where offline dictionary attacks are not possible
   without breaking into a threshold of servers (such a distributed
   solution requires no change or awareness on the client side relative
   to a single-server implementation).

   OPAQUE is defined and proven as the composition of two
   functionalities: an oblivious pseudorandom function (OPRF) and an
   authenticated key exchange (AKE) protocol.  It can be seen as a
   "compiler" for transforming any suitable AKE protocol into a secure
   aPAKE protocol.  (See Section 6 for requirements of the OPRF and AKE
   protocols.)  This document specifies one OPAQUE instantiation based
   on 3DH [SIGNAL].  Other instantiations are possible, as discussed in
   Appendix B, but their details are out of scope for this document.  In
   general, the modularity of OPAQUE's design makes it easy to integrate
   with additional AKE protocols, e.g., IKEv2, and with future ones such
   as those based on post-quantum techniques.

   OPAQUE consists of two stages: registration and authenticated key
   exchange.  In the first stage, a client registers its password with
   the server and stores its encrypted credentials on the server.  In
   the second stage, a client obtains those credentials, recovers them
   using the client's password, and subsequently uses them as input to
   an AKE protocol.

   Currently, the most widely deployed PKI-free aPAKE is SRP [RFC2945],
   which is vulnerable to pre-computation attacks, lacks a proof of
   security, and is less efficient relative to OPAQUE.  Moreover, SRP
   requires a ring as it mixes addition and multiplication operations,
   and thus does not work over plain elliptic curves.  OPAQUE is
   therefore a suitable replacement for applications that use SRP.

   This draft complies with the requirements for PAKE protocols set
   forth in [RFC8125].

1.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Notation

   The following terms are used throughout this document to describe the
   operations, roles, and behaviors of OPAQUE:

   *  Client (C): Entity which has knowledge of a password and wishes to
      authenticate.

   *  Server (S): Entity which authenticates clients using passwords.

   *  password: An opaque byte string containing the client's password.

   *  (skX, pkX): An AKE key pair used in role X; skX is the private key
      and pkX is the public key.  For example, (client_private_key,
      client_public_key) refers to C's private and public key.

   *  kX: An OPRF private key used for role X.  For example, as
      described in Section 3.3.2, oprf_key refers to the private OPRF
      key for client C known only to the server.

   *  I2OSP and OS2IP: Convert a byte string to and from a non-negative
      integer as described in [RFC8017].  Note that these functions
      operate on byte strings in big-endian byte order.

   *  concat(x0, ..., xN): Concatenate byte strings.  For example,
      "concat(0x01, 0x0203, 0x040506) = 0x010203040506".

   *  random(n): Generate a random byte string of length "n" bytes.

   *  xor(a,b): Apply XOR to byte strings.  For example, "xor(0xF0F0,
      0x1234) = 0xE2C4".  It is an error to call this function with two
      arguments of unequal length.

   *  ct_equal(a, b): Return "true" if "a" is equal to "b", and false
      otherwise.  This function is constant-time in the length of "a"
      and "b", which are assumed to be of equal length, irrespective of
      the values "a" or "b".

   Except if said otherwise, random choices in this specification refer
   to drawing with uniform distribution from a given set (i.e., "random"
   is short for "uniformly random").  Random choices can be replaced
   with fresh outputs from a cryptographically strong pseudorandom
   generator, according to the requirements in [RFC4086], or
   pseudorandom function.

   The name OPAQUE is a homonym of O-PAKE where O is for Oblivious.  The
   name OPAKE was taken.

2.  Cryptographic Protocol and Algorithm Dependencies

   OPAQUE relies on the following protocols and primitives:

   *  Oblivious Pseudorandom Function (OPRF, [I-D.irtf-cfrg-voprf]):

      -  Blind(x): Convert input "x" into an element of the OPRF group,
         randomize it by some scalar "r", producing "M", and output
         ("r", "M").

      -  KeyGen(): Generate an OPRF private and public key.  OPAQUE only
         requires an OPRF private key.  We write "(oprf_key, _) =
         KeyGen()" to denote use of this function for generating secret
         key "oprf_key" (and discarding the corresponding public key).

      -  Evaluate(k, M): Evaluate input element "M" using private key
         "k", yielding output element "Z".

      -  Unblind(r, Z): Remove random scalar "r" from "Z", yielding
         output "N".

      -  Finalize(x, N, info): Compute the OPRF output using input "x",
         "N", and domain separation tag "info".

      -  SerializeScalar(s): Map a scalar "s" to a unique byte array
         "buf" of fixed length.

      -  DeserializeScalar(buf): Map a byte array "buf" to a scalar "s",
         or fail if the input is not a valid byte representation of a
         scalar.

      -  SerializedElement: A serialized OPRF group element, a byte
         array of fixed length.

      -  SerializedScalar: A serialized OPRF scalar, a byte array of
         fixed length.

   *  Cryptographic hash function:

      -  Hash(m): Compute the cryptographic hash of input message "m".
         The type of the hash is determined by the chosen OPRF group.

      -  Nh: The output size of the Hash function.

   *  Memory Hard Function (MHF):

      -  Harden(msg, params): Repeatedly apply a memory hard function
         with parameters "params" to strengthen the input "msg" against
         offline dictionary attacks.  This function also needs to
         satisfy collision resistance.

   Note that we only need the base mode variant (as opposed to the
   verifiable mode variant) of the OPRF described in
   [I-D.irtf-cfrg-voprf].

3.  Offline Registration

   Registration is executed between a client C and a server S.  It is
   assumed S can identify C and the client can authenticate S during
   this registration phase.  This is the only part in OPAQUE that
   requires an authenticated channel, either physical, out-of-band, PKI-
   based, etc.  This section describes the registration flow, message
   encoding, and helper functions.  Moreover, C has a key pair
   (client_private_key, client_public_key) for an AKE protocol which is
   suitable for use with OPAQUE; See Section 4. (client_private_key,
   client_public_key) may be randomly generated for the account or
   provided by the calling client.  Clients MUST NOT use the same key
   pair (client_private_key, client_public_key) for two different
   accounts.

   To begin, C chooses password password, and S chooses its own pair of
   private-public keys server_private_key and server_public_key for use
   with the AKE.  S can use the same pair of keys with multiple clients.
   These steps can happen offline, i.e., before the registration phase.
   Once complete, the registration process proceeds as follows:

 Client (password, creds)            Server (server_private_key, server_public_key)
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 (request, blind) = CreateRegistrationRequest(password)

                               request
                      ------------------------->

            (response, oprf_key) = CreateRegistrationResponse(request, server_public_key)

                               response
                      <-------------------------

 (record, export_key) = FinalizeRequest(password, creds, blind, response)

                                record
                      ------------------------->

   Section 3.3 describes details of the functions referenced above.

   Both client and server MUST validate the other party's public key
   before use.  See Section 6.6 for more details.

   Upon completion, S stores C's credentials for later use.  See
   Section 3.3.4 for a recommended storage format.

3.1.  Credential Storage

   OPAQUE makes use of a structure "Envelope" to store client
   credentials.  The "Envelope" structure embeds the following types of
   credentials:

   *  client_private_key: The encoded client private key for the AKE
      protocol.

   *  server_public_key: The encoded server public key for the AKE
      protocol.

   *  client_identity: The client identity.  This is an application-
      specific value, e.g., an e-mail address or normal account name.

   *  server_identity: The server identity.  This is typically a domain
      name, e.g., example.com.  See Section 6.1.1 for information about
      this identity.

   Each public and private key value is an opaque byte string, specific
   to the AKE protocol in which OPAQUE is instantiated.  For example, if
   used as raw public keys for TLS 1.3 [RFC8446], they may be RSA or
   ECDSA keys as per [RFC7250].

   These credentials are incorporated in the "SecretCredentials" and
   "CleartextCredentials" structs, depending on the mode set by the
   value of "EnvelopeMode":

   enum {
     base(1),
     custom_identifier(2),
     (255)
   } EnvelopeMode;

   The "base" mode defines "SecretCredentials" and
   "CleartextCredentials" as follows:

   struct {
     opaque client_private_key<1..2^16-1>;
   } SecretCredentials;

   struct {
     opaque server_public_key<1..2^16-1>;
   } CleartextCredentials;

   The "custom_identifier" mode defines "SecretCredentials" and
   "CleartextCredentials" as follows:

   struct {
     opaque client_private_key<1..2^16-1>;
   } SecretCredentials;

   struct {
     opaque server_public_key<1..2^16-1>;
     opaque client_identity<0..2^16-1>;
     opaque server_identity<0..2^16-1>;
   } CleartextCredentials;

   These credentials are embedded into the following "Envelope"
   structure with encryption and authentication.

   struct {
     EnvelopeMode mode;
     opaque nonce[32];
     opaque encrypted_creds<1..2^16-1>;
   } InnerEnvelope;

   struct {
     InnerEnvelope inner_env;
     opaque auth_tag[Nh];
   } Envelope;

   mode  The "EnvelopeMode" value.  This MUST be one of "base" or
      "custom_identifier".

   nonce  A unique 32-byte nonce used to protect this Envelope.

   encrypted_creds  Encoding of encrypted and authenticated
      "SecretCredentials".

   auth_tag  Authentication tag protecting the contents of the envelope,
      covering "InnerEnvelope" and "CleartextCredentials".

   The full procedure for constructing "Envelope" and "InnerEnvelope"
   from "SecretCredentials" and "CleartextCredentials" is described in
   Section 3.3.3.  Note that only "SecretCredentials" are stored in the
   "Envelope" (in encrypted form).

   The "EnvelopeMode" value is specified as part of the configuration
   (see Section 5).

   Credential information corresponding to the configuration-specific
   mode, along with the client public key "client_public_key" and
   private key "client_private_key", are stored in a "Credentials"
   object with the following named fields:

   *  "client_private_key", the client's private key

   *  "client_public_key", the client's public key corresponding to
      "client_private_key"

   *  "client_identity", an optional client identity (present only in
      the "custom_identifier" mode)

   *  "server_identity", an optional server identity (present only in
      the "custom_identifier" mode)

3.2.  Registration Messages

   struct {
       SerializedElement data;
   } RegistrationRequest;

   data  A serialized OPRF group element.

   struct {
       SerializedElement data;

   } RegistrationResponse;

   data  A serialized OPRF group element.

   server_public_key  An encoded public key that will be used for the
      online authenticated key exchange stage.

   struct {

       Envelope envelope;
   } RegistrationUpload;

   client_public_key  An encoded public key, corresponding to the
      private key "client_private_key".

3.3.  Registration Functions

3.3.1.  CreateRegistrationRequest

   CreateRegistrationRequest(password)

   Input:
   - password, an opaque byte string containing the client's password

   Output:
   - request, a RegistrationRequest structure
   - blind, an OPRF scalar value

   Steps:
   1. (blind, M) = Blind(password)
   2. Create RegistrationRequest request with M
   3. Output (request, blind)

3.3.2.  CreateRegistrationResponse

   CreateRegistrationResponse(request, server_public_key)

   Input:
   - request, a RegistrationRequest structure
   - server_public_key, the server's public key

   Output:
   - response, a RegistrationResponse structure
   - oprf_key, the per-client OPRF key known only to the server

   Steps:
   1. (oprf_key, _) = KeyGen()
   2. Z = Evaluate(oprf_key, request.data)
   3. Create RegistrationResponse response with (Z, server_public_key)
   4. Output (response, oprf_key)

3.3.3.  FinalizeRequest

FinalizeRequest(password, creds, blind, response)

Parameters:
- params, the MHF parameters established out of band
- mode, the InnerEnvelope mode
- Nh, the output size of the Hash function

Input:
- password, an opaque byte string containing the client's password
- creds, a Credentials structure
- blind, an OPRF scalar value
- response, a RegistrationResponse structure

Output:
- record, a RegistrationUpload structure
- export_key, an additional key

Steps:
1. N = Unblind(blind, response.data)
2. y = Finalize(password, N, "OPAQUE")
3. envelope_nonce = random(32)
4. prk = HKDF-Extract(envelope_nonce, Harden(y, params))
5. Create SecretCredentials secret_creds with creds.client_private_key
6. Create CleartextCredentials cleartext_creds with response.server_public_key
   and custom identifiers creds.client_identity and creds.server_identity if
   mode is custom_identifier
7. pseudorandom_pad =
     HKDF-Expand(prk, "Pad", len(secret_creds))
8. auth_key = HKDF-Expand(prk, "AuthKey", Nh)
9. export_key = HKDF-Expand(prk, "ExportKey", Nh)
10. encrypted_creds = xor(secret_creds, pseudorandom_pad)
11. Create InnerEnvelope inner_env
      with (mode, envelope_nonce, encrypted_creds)
12. auth_tag = HMAC(auth_key, concat(inner_env, cleartext_creds))
13. Create Envelope envelope with (inner_env, auth_tag)
14. Create RegistrationUpload record with (envelope, creds.client_public_key)
15. Output (record, export_key)

   The inputs to HKDF-Extract and HKDF-Expand are as specified in
   [RFC5869].  The underlying hash function is that which is associated
   with the OPAQUE configuration (see Section 5).

   See Section 4 for details about the output export_key usage.

   Upon completion of this function, the client MUST send "record" to
   the server.

3.3.4.  Credential File

   The server then constructs and stores the "credential_file" object,
   where "envelope" and "client_public_key" are obtained from "record",
   and "oprf_key" is retained from the output of
   "CreateRegistrationResponse". "oprf_key" is serialized using
   "SerializeScalar".

   struct {
       SerializedScalar oprf_key;
       opaque client_public_key<1..2^16-1>;
       Envelope envelope;
   } credential_file;

4.  Online Authenticated Key Exchange

   After registration, the client and server run the authenticated key
   exchange stage of the OPAQUE protocol.  This stage is composed of a
   concurrent OPRF and key exchange flow.  The key exchange protocol is
   authenticated using the client and server credentials established
   during registration; see Section 3.  The type of keys MUST be
   suitable for the key exchange protocol.  For example, if the key
   exchange protocol is 3DH, as described in Section 4.2.2, then the
   private and public keys must be Diffie-Hellman keys.  At the end, the
   client proves its knowledge of the password, and both client and
   server agree on a mutually authenticated shared secret key.

   OPAQUE produces two outputs: a session secret and an export key.  The
   export key may be used for additional application-specific purposes,
   as outlined in Section 6.3.  The output "export_key" MUST NOT be used
   in any way before the HMAC value in the envelope is validated.  See
   Section 6.2 for more details about this requirement.

4.1.  Credential Retrieval

   The online AKE stage of the protocol requires clients to obtain and
   decrypt their credentials from the server-stored envelope.  This
   process is similar to the offline registration stage, as shown below.

 Client (password)             Server (server_private_key, server_public_key, credential_file)
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 (request, blind) = CreateCredentialRequest(password)

                               request
                      ------------------------->

    response = CreateCredentialResponse(request, server_public_key, credential_file)

                               response
                      <-------------------------

 (client_private_key, server_public_key, export_key) =
     RecoverCredentials(password, blind, response)

4.2.  AKE Instantiations

   This section describes instantiations of OPAQUE using 3-message AKEs
   which satisfies the forward secrecy and KCI properties discussed in
   Section 6.  As shown in [OPAQUE], OPAQUE cannot use less than three
   messages so the 3-message instantiations presented here are optimal
   in terms of number of messages.  On the other hand, there is no
   impediment of using OPAQUE with protocols with more than 3 messages
   as in the case of IKEv2 (or the underlying SIGMA-R protocol [SIGMA]).

   The generic outline of OPAQUE with a 3-message AKE protocol includes
   three messages KE1, KE2, and KE3, where KE1 and KE2 include key
   exchange shares, e.g., DH values, sent by client and server,
   respectively, and KE3 provides explicit client authentication and
   full forward security (without it, forward secrecy is only achieved
   against eavesdroppers which is insufficient for OPAQUE security).

   The output of the authentication phase is a session secret
   "session_key" and export key "export_key".  Applications can use
   "session_key" to derive additional keying material as needed.  Key
   derivation and other details of the protocol are specified by the AKE
   scheme.  We note that by the results in [OPAQUE], KE2 and KE3 must
   authenticate credential_request and credential_response,
   respectively, for binding between the underlying OPRF protocol
   messages and the KE session.

   The rest of this section includes key schedule utility functions used
   by OPAQUE-3DH, and then provides a detailed specification for OPAQUE-
   3DH, including its wire format messages.

4.2.1.  Key Schedule Utility Functions

   The key derivation procedures for OPAQUE-3DH makes use of the
   functions below, re-purposed from TLS 1.3 [RFC8446].

   HKDF-Expand-Label(Secret, Label, Context, Length) =
     HKDF-Expand(Secret, HkdfLabel, Length)

   Where HkdfLabel is specified as:

   struct {
      uint16 length = Length;
      opaque label<8..255> = "OPAQUE " + Label;
      opaque context<0..255> = Context;
   } HkdfLabel;

   Derive-Secret(Secret, Label, Transcript) =
       HKDF-Expand-Label(Secret, Label, Hash(Transcript), Nh)

   HKDF uses Hash as its underlying hash function, which is the same as
   that which is indicated by the OPAQUE instantiation.  Note that the
   Label parameter is not a NULL-terminated string.

4.2.2.  OPAQUE-3DH Instantiation

   OPAQUE-3DH is implemented using a suitable prime order group.  All
   operations in the key derivation steps in Section 4.2.2.2 are
   performed in this group and represented here using multiplicative
   notation.  The output of OPAQUE-3DH is a session secret "session_key"
   and export key "export_key".

4.2.2.1.  OPAQUE-3DH Messages

   The three messages for OPAQUE-3DH are described below.

   struct {
     CredentialRequest request;
     uint8 client_nonce[32];
     opaque client_info<0..2^16-1>;
     uint8 client_keyshare[Npk];
   } KE1;

   request  A "CredentialRequest" generated according to
      Section 4.1.2.1.

   client_nonce  A fresh 32-byte randomly generated nonce.

   client_info  Optional application-specific information to exchange
      during the protocol.

   client_keyshare  Client ephemeral key share of fixed size Npk, where
      Npk depends on the corresponding prime order group.

   struct {
     CredentialResponse response;
     uint8 server_nonce[32];
     uint8 server_keyshare[Npk];
     opaque enc_server_info<0..2^16-1>;
     uint8 mac[Nh];
   } KE2;

   response  A "CredentialResponse" generated according to
      Section 4.1.2.2.

   server_nonce  A fresh 32-byte randomly generated nonce.

   server_keyshare  Server ephemeral key share of fixed size Npk, where
      Npk depends on the corresponding prime order group.

   enc_server_info  Optional application-specific information to
      exchange during the protocol encrypted under key Ke2, defined
      below.

   mac  An authentication tag computed over the handshake transcript
      computed using Km2, defined below.

   struct {
     uint8 mac[Nh];
   } KE3;

   mac  An authentication tag computed over the handshake transcript
      computed using Km3, defined below.

4.2.2.2.  OPAQUE-3DH Key Schedule

   OPAQUE-3DH requires MAC keys "server_mac_key" and "client_mac_key"
   and encryption key "handshake_encrypt_key".  Additionally, OPAQUE-3DH
   also outputs "session_key".  The schedule for computing this key
   material is below.

   HKDF-Extract(salt=0, IKM)
       |
       +-> Derive-Secret(., "handshake secret", info) = handshake_secret
       |
       +-> Derive-Secret(., "session secret", info) = session_key

   From "handshake_secret", Km2, Km3, and Ke2 are computed as follows:

   server_mac_key =
     HKDF-Expand-Label(handshake_secret, "server mac", "", Nh)
   client_mac_key =
     HKDF-Expand-Label(handshake_secret, "client mac", "", Nh)
   handshake_encrypt_key =
     HKDF-Expand-Label(handshake_secret, "handshake enc", "", Nh)

   Nh is the output length of the underlying hash function.

   The HKDF input parameter "info" is computed as follows:

  info = "3DH keys" || I2OSP(len(client_nonce), 2) || client_nonce
                    || I2OSP(len(server_nonce), 2) || server_nonce
                    || I2OSP(len(client_identity), 2) || client_identity
                    || I2OSP(len(server_identity), 2) || server_identity

   See Section 6.1.1 for more information about identities
   client_identity and server_identity.

   Let "epkS" and "eskS" be "server_keyshare" and the corresponding
   secret key, and "epkU" and "eskU" be "client_keyshare" and the
   corresponding secret key.  The input parameter "IKM" the
   concatenation of three DH values computed by the client as follows:

   IKM = epkS^eskU || pkS^eskU || epkS^skU

   Likewise, "IKM" is computed by the server as follows:

   IKM = epkU^eskS || epkU^skS || pkU^eskS

4.2.2.3.  OPAQUE-3DH Encryption and Key Confirmation {#3dh-core}

   Clients and servers use keys Km2 and Km3 in computing KE2.mac and
   KE3.mac, respectively.  These values are computed as HMAC(mac_key,
   transcript), where mac_key and transcript are as follows:

   *  KE2.mac: mac_key is Km2 and transcript is the concatenation of KE1
      and KE2, excluding KE2.mac.

   *  KE3.mac: mac_key is Km3 and transcript is the concatenation of KE1
      and KE2, including KE2.mac.

   The server applicaton info, an opaque byte string "server_info", is
   encrypted using a technique similar to that used for secret
   credential encryption.  Specifically, a one-time-pad is derived from
   Ke2 and then used as input to XOR with the plaintext.  In pseudocode,
   this is done as follows:

   info_pad = HKDF-Expand(Ke2, "encryption pad", len(server_info))
   enc_server_info = xor(info_pad, server_info)

5.  Configurations

   An OPAQUE configuration is a tuple (OPRF, Hash, MHF, EnvelopeMode).
   The OPAQUE OPRF protocol is drawn from the "base mode" variant of
   [I-D.irtf-cfrg-voprf].  The following OPRF ciphersuites are
   supported:

   *  OPRF(ristretto255, SHA-512)

   *  OPRF(decaf448, SHA-512)

   *  OPRF(P-256, SHA-256)

   *  OPRF(P-384, SHA-512)

   *  OPRF(P-521, SHA-512)

   Future configurations may specify different OPRF constructions.

   The OPAQUE hash function is that which is associated with the OPRF
   ciphersuite.  For the ciphersuites specified here, only SHA-512 and
   SHA-256 are supported.

   The OPAQUE MHFs include Argon2 [I-D.irtf-cfrg-argon2], scrypt
   [RFC7914], and PBKDF2 [RFC2898] with fixed parameter choices.

   The EnvelopeMode value is defined in Section 3.1.  It MUST be one of
   "base" or "custom_identifier".  Future specifications may specify
   alternate EnvelopeMode values and their corresponding Envelope
   structure.

6.  Security Considerations

   OPAQUE is defined and proven as the composition of two
   functionalities: an OPRF and an AKE protocol.  It can be seen as a
   "compiler" for transforming any AKE protocol (with KCI security and
   forward secrecy - see below) into a secure aPAKE protocol.  In
   OPAQUE, the client stores a secret private key at the server during
   password registration and retrieves this key each time it needs to
   authenticate to the server.  The OPRF security properties ensure that
   only the correct password can unlock the private key while at the
   same time avoiding potential offline guessing attacks.  This general
   composability property provides great flexibility and enables a
   variety of OPAQUE instantiations, from optimized performance to
   integration with TLS.  The latter aspect is of prime importance as
   the use of OPAQUE with TLS constitutes a major security improvement
   relative to the standard password-over-TLS practice.  At the same
   time, the combination with TLS builds OPAQUE as a fully functional
   secure communications protocol and can help provide privacy to
   account information sent by the client to the server prior to
   authentication.

   The KCI property required from AKE protocols for use with OPAQUE
   states that knowledge of a party's private key does not allow an
   attacker to impersonate others to that party.  This is an important
   security property achieved by most public-key based AKE protocols,
   including protocols that use signatures or public key encryption for
   authentication.  It is also a property of many implicitly
   authenticated protocols, e.g., HMQV, but not all of them.  We also
   note that key exchange protocols based on shared keys do not satisfy
   the KCI requirement, hence they are not considered in the OPAQUE
   setting.  We note that KCI is needed to ensure a crucial property of
   OPAQUE: even upon compromise of the server, the attacker cannot
   impersonate the client to the server without first running an
   exhaustive dictionary attack.  Another essential requirement from AKE
   protocols for use in OPAQUE is to provide forward secrecy (against
   active attackers).

6.1.  Related Analysis

   Jarecki et al.  [OPAQUE] proved the security of OPAQUE in a strong
   aPAKE model that ensures security against pre-computation attacks and
   is formulated in the Universal Composability (UC) framework
   [Canetti01] under the random oracle model.  This assumes security of
   the OPRF function and of the underlying key exchange protocol.  In
   turn, the security of the OPRF protocol from [I-D.irtf-cfrg-voprf] is
   proven in the random oracle model under the One-More Diffie-Hellman
   assumption [JKKX16].

   Very few aPAKE protocols have been proven formally, and those proven
   were analyzed in a weak security model that allows for pre-
   computation attacks (e.g., [GMR06]).  This is not just a formal
   issue: these protocols are actually vulnerable to such attacks.  This
   includes protocols that have recent analyses in the UC model such as
   AuCPace [AuCPace] and SPAKE2+ [SPAKE2plus].  We note that as shown in
   [OPAQUE], these protocols, and any aPAKE in the model from [GMR06],
   can be converted into an aPAKE secure against pre-computation attacks
   at the expense of an additional OPRF execution.

   OPAQUE's design builds on a line of work initiated in the seminal
   paper of Ford and Kaliski [FK00] and is based on the HPAKE protocol
   of Xavier Boyen [Boyen09] and the (1,1)-PPSS protocol from Jarecki et
   al.  [JKKX16].  None of these papers considered security against pre-
   computation attacks or presented a proof of aPAKE security (not even
   in a weak model).

6.1.1.  Identities

   AKE protocols generate keys that need to be uniquely and verifiably
   bound to a pair of identities.  In the case of OPAQUE, those
   identities correspond to client_identity and server_identity.  Thus,
   it is essential for the parties to agree on such identities,
   including an agreed bit representation of these identities as needed.

   Applications may have different policies about how and when
   identities are determined.  A natural approach is to tie
   client_identity to the identity the server uses to fetch envelope
   (hence determined during password registration) and to tie
   server_identity to the server identity used by the client to initiate
   an offline password registration or online authenticated key exchange
   session. server_identity and client_identity can also be part of
   envelope or be tied to the parties' public keys.  In principle, it is
   possible that identities change across different sessions as long as
   there is a policy that can establish if the identity is acceptable or
   not to the peer.  However, we note that the public keys of both the
   server and the client must always be those defined at time of
   password registration.

6.2.  Envelope Encryption

   The analysis of OPAQUE from [OPAQUE] requires the authenticated
   encryption scheme used to produce envelope to have a special property
   called random key-robustness (or key-committing).  This specification
   enforces this property by utilizing encrypt-then-HMAC in the
   construction of envelope.  There is no option to use another
   authenticated-encryption scheme with this specification.  (Deviating
   from the key-robustness requirement may open the protocol to attacks,
   e.g., [LGR20].)  We remark that export_key for authentication or
   encryption requires no special properties from the authentication or
   encryption schemes as long as export_key is used only after the
   envelope is validated, i.e., after the HMAC in RecoverCredentials
   passes verification.

6.3.  Export Key Usage

   The export key can be used (separately from the OPAQUE protocol) to
   provide confidentiality and integrity to other data which only the
   client should be able to process.  For instance, if the server is
   expected to maintain any client-side secrets which require a password
   to access, then this export key can be used to encrypt these secrets
   so that they remain hidden from the server.

6.4.  Configuration Choice

   Best practices regarding implementation of cryptographic schemes
   apply to OPAQUE.  Particular care needs to be given to the
   implementation of the OPRF regarding testing group membership and
   avoiding timing and other side channel leakage in the hash-to-curve
   mapping.  Drafts [I-D.irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve] and
   [I-D.irtf-cfrg-voprf] have detailed instantiation and implementation
   guidance.

6.5.  Static Diffie-Hellman Oracles

   While one can expect the practical security of the OPRF function
   (namely, the hardness of computing the function without knowing the
   key) to be in the order of computing discrete logarithms or solving
   Diffie-Hellman, Brown and Gallant [BG04] and Cheon [Cheon06] show an
   attack that slightly improves on generic attacks.  For the case that
   q-1 or q+1, where q is the order of the group G, has a t-bit divisor,
   they show an attack that calls the OPRF on 2^t chosen inputs and
   reduces security by t/2 bits, i.e., it can find the OPRF key in time
   2^{q/2-t/2} and 2^{q/2-t/2} memory.  For typical curves, the attack
   requires an infeasible number of calls and/or results in
   insignificant security loss (*).  Moreover, in the OPAQUE
   application, these attacks are completely impractical as the number
   of calls to the function translates to an equal number of failed
   authentication attempts by a _single_ client.  For example, one would
   need a billion impersonation attempts to reduce security by 15 bits
   and a trillion to reduce it by 20 bits - and most curves will not
   even allow for such attacks in the first place (note that this
   theoretical loss of security is with respect to computing discrete
   logarithms, not in reducing the password strength).

   (*) Some examples (courtesy of Dan Brown): For P-384, 2^90 calls
   reduce security from 192 to 147 bits; for NIST P-256 the options are
   6-bit reduction with 2153 OPRF calls, about 14 bit reduction with 187
   million calls and 20 bits with a trillion calls.  For Curve25519,
   attacks are completely infeasible (require over 2^100 calls) but its
   twist form allows an attack with 25759 calls that reduces security by
   7 bits and one with 117223 calls that reduces security by 8.4 bits.

6.6.  Input Validation

   Both client and server MUST validate the other party's public key(s)
   used for the execution of OPAQUE.  This includes the keys shared
   during the offline registration phase, as well as any keys shared
   during the online key agreement phase.  The validation procedure
   varies depending on the type of key.  For example, for OPAQUE
   instantiations using 3DH with P-256, P-384, or P-521 as the
   underlying group, validation is as specified in Section 5.6.2.3.4 of
   [keyagreement].  This includes checking that the coordinates are in
   the correct range, that the point is on the curve, and that the point
   is not the point at infinity.  Additionally, validation MUST ensure
   the Diffie-Hellman shared secret is not the point at infinity.  For
   X25519 and X448, validation is as described in [RFC7748].  In
   particular, where applicable, endpoints MUST check whether the
   Diffie-Hellman shared secret is the all-zero value and abort if so.

6.7.  OPRF Hardening

   Hardening the output of the OPRF greatly increases the cost of an
   offline attack upon the compromise of the password file at the
   server.  Applications SHOULD select parameters that balance cost and
   complexity.

6.8.  Client and Server Identities

   The client identity (client_identity) and server identity
   (server_identity) are optional parameters which are left to the
   application to designate as monikers for the client and server.  If
   the application layer does not supply values for these parameters,
   then they will be omitted from the creation of the envelope during
   the registration stage.  Furthermore, they will be substituted with
   client_identity = client_public_key and server_identity =
   server_public_key during the authenticated key exchange stage.

   The advantage to supplying a custom client_identity and
   server_identity (instead of simply relying on a fallback to
   client_public_key and server_public_key) is that the client can then
   ensure that any mappings between client_identity and
   client_public_key (and server_identity and server_public_key) are
   protected by the authentication from the envelope.  Then, the client
   can verify that the client_identity and server_identity contained in
   its envelope matches the client_identity and server_identity supplied
   by the server.

   However, if this extra layer of verification is unnecessary for the
   application, then simply leaving client_identity and server_identity
   unspecified (and using client_public_key and server_public_key
   instead) is acceptable.

6.9.  Client Enumeration

   Client enumeration refers to attacks where the attacker tries to
   learn whether a given client identity is registered with a server.
   Preventing such attacks requires the server to act with unknown
   client identities in a way that is indistinguishable from its
   behavior with existing clients.  Here we suggest a way to implement
   such defense, namely, a way for simulating a CredentialResponse for
   non-existing clients.  Note that if the same CredentialRequest is
   received twice by the server, the response needs to be the same in
   both cases (since this would be the case for real clients).  For
   protection against this attack, one would apply the encryption
   function in the construction of envelope to all the key material in
   envelope.  The server S will have two keys MK, MK' for a pseudorandom
   function f. f refers to a regular pseudorandom function such as HMAC
   or CMAC.  Upon receiving a CredentialRequest for a non-existing
   client client_identity, S computes oprf_key=f(MK; client_identity)
   and oprf_key'=f(MK'; client_identity) and responds with
   CredentialResponse carrying Z=M^oprf_key and envelope, where the
   latter is computed as follows. prk is set to oprf_key' and
   secret_creds is set to the all-zero string (of the length of a
   regular envelope plaintext).  Care needs to be taken to avoid side
   channel leakage (e.g., timing) from helping differentiate these
   operations from a regular server response.  The above requires
   changes to the server-side implementation but not to the protocol
   itself or the client side.

   There is one form of leakage that the above allows and whose
   prevention would require a change in OPAQUE.  An attacker that
   attempts authentication with the same CredentialRequest twice and
   receives different responses can conclude that either the client
   registered with the service between these two activations or that the
   client was registered before but changed its password in between the
   activations (assuming the server changes oprf_key at the time of a
   password change).  In any case, this indicates that client_identity
   is a registered client at the time of the second activation.  To
   conceal this information, S can implement the derivation of oprf_key
   as oprf_key=f(MK; client_identity) also for registered clients.
   Hiding changes in envelope, however, requires a change in the
   protocol.  Instead of sending envelope as is, S would send an
   encryption of envelope under a key that the client derives from the
   OPRF result (similarly to prk) and that S stores during password
   registration.  During the authenticated key exchange stage, the
   client will derive this key from the OPRF result, will use it to
   decrypt envelope, and continue with the regular protocol.  If S uses
   a randomized encryption, the encrypted envelope will look each time
   as a fresh random string, hence S can simulate the encrypted envelope
   also for non-existing clients.

   Note that the first case above does not change the protocol so its
   implementation is a server's decision (the client side is not
   changed).  The second case, requires changes on the client side so it
   changes OPAQUE itself.

   [[https://github.com/cfrg/draft-irtf-cfrg-opaque/issues/22: Should
   this variant be documented/standardized?]]

6.10.  Password Salt and Storage Implications

   In OPAQUE, the OPRF key acts as the secret salt value that ensures
   the infeasibility of pre-computation attacks.  No extra salt value is
   needed.  Also, clients never disclose their password to the server,
   even during registration.  Note that a corrupted server can run an
   exhaustive offline dictionary attack to validate guesses for the
   client's password; this is inevitable in any aPAKE protocol.  (OPAQUE
   enables a defense against such offline dictionary attacks by
   distributing the server so that an offline attack is only possible if
   all - or a minimal number of - servers are compromised [OPAQUE].)

   Some applications may require learning the client's password for
   enforcing password rules.  Doing so invalidates this important
   security property of OPAQUE and is NOT RECOMMENDED.  Applications
   should move such checks to the client.  Note that limited checks at
   the server are possible to implement, e.g., detecting repeated
   passwords.

Appendix B.  Alternate AKE instantiations

   It is possible to instantiate OPAQUE with other AKEs, such as HMQV
   [HMQV] and SIGMA-I.  HMQV is similar to 3DH but varies in its key
   schedule.  SIGMA-I uses digital signatures rather than static DH keys
   for authentication.  Specification of these instantiations is left to
   future documents.  A sketch of how these instantiations might change
   is included below for posterity.

   OPAQUE may also be instantiated with any post-quantum (PQ) AKE
   protocol that has the message flow above and security properties (KCI
   resistance and forward secrecy) outlined in Section 6.  Note that
   such an instantiation is not quantum safe unless the OPRF is quantum
   safe.  However, an OPAQUE instantiation where the AKE is quantum
   safe, but the OPRF is not, would still ensure the confidentiality of
   application data encrypted under session_key (or a key derived from
   it) with a quantum-safe encryption function.

B.1.  HMQV Instantiation Sketch

   An HMQV instantiation would work similar to OPAQUE-3DH, differing
   primarily in the key schedule [HMQV].  First, the key schedule "info"
   value would use a different constant prefix -- "HMQV keys" instead of
   "3DH keys" -- as shown below.

 info = "HMQV keys" || I2OSP(len(client_nonce), 2) || client_nonce
                    || I2OSP(len(server_nonce), 2) || server_nonce
                    || I2OSP(len(client_identity), 2) || client_identity
                    || I2OSP(len(server_identity), 2) || server_identity

   Second, the IKM derivation would change.  Assuming HMQV is
   instantiated with a cyclic group of prime order p with bit length L,
   clients would compute "IKM" as follows:

   u' = (eskU + u \* skU) mod p
   IKM = (epkS \* pkS^s)^u'

   Likewise, servers would compute "IKM" as follows:

   s' = (eskS + s \* skS) mod p
   IKM = (epkU \* pkU^u)^s'

   In both cases, "u" would be computed as follows:

   hashInput = I2OSP(len(epkU), 2) || epkU ||
               I2OSP(len(info), 2) || info ||
               I2OSP(len("client"), 2) || "client"
   u = Hash(hashInput) mod L

   Likewise, "s" would be computed as follows:

   hashInput = I2OSP(len(epkS), 2) || epkS ||
               I2OSP(len(info), 2) || info ||
               I2OSP(len("server"), 2) || "server"
   s = Hash(hashInput) mod L

   Hash is the same hash function used in the main OPAQUE protocol for
   key derivation.  Its output length (in bits) must be at least L.

B.2.  SIGMA-I Instantiation Sketch

   A SIGMA-I instantiation differs more drastically from OPAQUE-3DH,
   since authentication uses digital signatures in lieu of Diffie
   Hellman.  In particular, both KE2 and KE3 would carry a digital
   signature, computed using the server and client private keys
   established during registration, respectively, as well as a MAC,
   where the MAC is computed as in OPAQUE-3DH.

   The key schedule would also change.  Specifically, the key schedule
   "info" value would use a different constant prefix -- "SIGMA-I keys"
   instead of "3DH keys" -- and the "IKM" computation would use only the
   ephemeral key shares exchanged between client and server.

Appendix C.  Test Vectors

   This section contains test vectors for the OPAQUE-3DH specification.
   Each test vector specifies the configuration information, protocol
   inputs, intermeidate values computed during registration and
   authentication, and protocol outputs.  All values are encoded in
   hexadecimal strings.  The configuration information includes the
   (OPRF, Hash, MHF, EnvelopeMode) tuple, along with the group to which
   the AKE authentication keys correspond.
